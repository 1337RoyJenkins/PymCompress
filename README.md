# PymCompress

# What is Pym?
  Pym is an RLE CODEC designed with the purpose of compressing text files. In case you don't happen to be as big of a comic geek as this CODEC's developer (aka me), The name is a nod to Hank Pym, alter-ego of Marvel Comics character Ant Man, famed for his ability to compress himself to extremely small sizes through the use of his trademark "Pym Particles". 

# Why did you write Pym?
  Pym is an simple RLE CODEC for compression of .txt files, written for an assignment for ITI 1120 - Introduction to Computing at the University of Ottawa. The assignment was to design an RLE CODEC to compress text files, and specified certain requirements for what is and isn't supported, so its uses are pretty limited. Pym is not intended for any form of distribution or use, it's just an assignment for a class.
  
  TL;DR - Because it was homework.
  
# On that note, who are YOU?
  Really? This is your THIRD question? I would have figured most people might have started off with that one... Anyways, my name is Lukas Horak and I'm just some computer geek who's gone back to school for Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. Nothing special, really. In fact, I'd be surprised if anyone actually reads this far down. I could probably just write anything I wanted down here and nobody would know... Tittysprinkles! See? Nobody's reading this. Well, back on point, I'm only posting this on GitHub to pad my portfolio.
  
  If you've actually read this far, well then I have a couple things to say to you:
  
  1 - Why?? There's PLENTY of better things you could have done with your time.
  2 - Congrats on making it this far, I guess... As a reward, here's a joke:
